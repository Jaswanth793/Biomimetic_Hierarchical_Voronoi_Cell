# Biomimetic_Heirarchical_Voronoi_Cell

This is a stepping-stone project for my integrated master's thesis at the Mechanics of Materials Lab, IIT Madras. 

I've explored the impact absorption behavior of Hierarchical Auxetic Unit Cells (HAUCs) with Voronoi substructures, which feature a density distribution similar to that of human trabecular bone. The trabecular bone is porous, but it has a much denser solid fraction in regions where loads are typically high, and vice versa. Similarly, we adapt this idea to take an HAUC with a uniform Voronoi distribution and then simply redistribute the Voronoi pattern such that it is denser in regions where stress levels would be higher, and less dense in regions where no load is being carried by the HAUC.

A biomimetic approach yielded almost an 83% increase in energy absorption per unit mass compared to the uniform HAUC (22 kJ/kg vs. 12 kJ/kg) at a 20 m/s impact.
